              As a Software Engineer my approach is framed by years in
              technology and design. With a background of the formal analysis of art, 
              study of communications as well as User Experience, during my training at
              the Fashion Institute of Technology. Iâ€™ve always enjoyed my ability to appreciate art and
              design with their loose boundaries and interprications while also
              having a deep love for logic, puzzles and their natural
              rigidity.
