              As a Software Engineer my approach is framed by years in technology and design. At the top design school The Fashion Institute of Technology my studies included the formal analysis of art, communications as well as User Experience.
               Iâ€™ve always been proud of my ability to appreciate and understand art and
              design with their loose boundaries and interprications, while on the other hand having a deep understanding and love for logic, puzzles and their natural
              rigidity.
